        physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

        subject
        to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other
        material.
        Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
